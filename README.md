# Alexa Virtual Space Tour
#### CMSC389L Final Project

## Overview

#### Alexa as an assistant for a space tour. 

Users can ask Alexa to take them for a space tour. Alex will start off with the sun, the display being on the screen and Alexa side by side talking about it. You can ask her to move to differet celestial object, and so will the display. 

#### Future Plans to be Implemented:

The goal is to implement VR in viewing the display so there is a 3D factor to it as well. Extend the model to outer solar system objects as well.
